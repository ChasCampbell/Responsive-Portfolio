			<h1>About Me</h1>

			<img src="assets/images/Chas.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Photo of Chas">

			<p>A degree in engineering from Georgia Tech and an MBA from South Carolina indicate skills in management and technology. Time spent practicing engineering with Dupont and Burlington Industries led to a career change into sales of the devices he previously
				bought.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Subsequently, he bacame an owner of the manufacturer's representative firm with which he had beem employed. Time spent there allowed him to use and develop the management skills in the real world.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Now, returning to those technical roots, previous experience in Algol, Fortran, and Cobol is being enhanced with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and Node.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Not to suggest that this is someone who is only about work. Other interests include theater (two years on the board of Charlotte Repertory Theatre) and opera along with Panthers Football, running, and travel. He was also an active member of the Jaycees
				and served as President of the Camden Jaycees and as Treasurer of the South Carolina Jaycees.</p>
